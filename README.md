## Description

This is a website designed for the user to answer a survey. It has five questions with the possibility of another one if it requires a tie-breaker. There is an alert if the user does not answer a question. All together, there are 8 questions within the document with three possible results.

## Setup/Installation Requirements:

### Installation requirements

    * Computer with browser
    * Internet

### Setup

    1. Download or clone the repository onto your desktop.
    2. Open the .zip file then enter the new folder called "programming-language-survey-main"
    3. Open index.html using a browser such as Mozilla or Chrome.

## Known Bugs

1. If a bonus question appears and the first five questions have an answer changed, then the bonus question does not hide. However, the bonus question can switch if the user's result requires another tie-breaker.
2. If the browser window shrinks by its width, the jumbotron will squeeze inside Q1.
